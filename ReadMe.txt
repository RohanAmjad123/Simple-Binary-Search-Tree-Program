A BST program that reads words from a text file into a BST (Binary Search Tree). It shows the user: how many words are in the text file, how many unique words are in the text file, and the most occuring words. It also lets the user find a specific word or print out the BST in Pre-Order, In-Order, Post-Order.

Notes: 

- Compile and execute Main.java
- Enter the input text filename plus extension when prompted
- Enter complete filepath and filename with extension if the input text files are not in the local folder
- Do not leave a space at the end of the filename or else it might give an error
